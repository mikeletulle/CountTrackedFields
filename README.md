This customization shows all of the objects that have field tracking turned on in the system and which fields on those objects are being tracked

It is VisualForce based and in order to make sure that no query goes above the 100 query limit it uses an iframe per object with its own controller

You launch it by just going to ../apex/showAllTrackedFields
